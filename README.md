# Lloyd-Quantization
4J03 "Communication systems" Project

###### Summary:

Program that applies Lloyd's quantization alogrithim to demonstrate the effects of lossy compression. This matlab program takes the audio sample "audioSample.wav" and generates two compressed result; uniform quantization + optimum quantiation.

*Notice the contrast in the SQNR (signal to noise ratio) between the two compression methods*

###### Visual comparison of uniform vs optimum quantization:

###### Note:

*Test Audio "audioSample.wav" not given in repository*

*Sampling interval is hardcoded from 0.5 seconds to 2.5 seconds of the given audio sample (i.e. value defined as "start_sample" and "end_sample")*
